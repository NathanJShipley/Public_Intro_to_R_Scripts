# R_Scripts_Public_Repo
This is a public repo of my custom R script library that I wrote for beginners to learn various techniques in R. I wrote most of this code several years ago, so some chunks might be outdated.

I might try and go back to clean some things up AND/OR add some example data for the scripts that need to read in data.
